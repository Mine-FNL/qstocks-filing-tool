**Turn a PDF financial report into a lossless, auditable filing JSON — ready for ingest.**

A jurisdiction-agnostic engine that takes any exchange's annual / interim report
(IFRS, AAOIFI, or anything in between) and emits a single stable, fingerprintable
JSON object: every number, the audit opinion, segments, note text, and provenance.
Pluggable profiles (Qatar ships out of the box; AE / SA / KW are one directory drop away).

Two modes: **local browser app** (drag-and-drop, ~3 min to first JSON) or
**one-command CLI** (scriptable, idempotent batches with SQLite-backed resume).

### Why this, not `pdfplumber` / `camelot` / `marker`?

| Tool | Strong at | Weak at — for *financial filings* specifically |
|---|---|---|
| `pdfplumber` | raw text + table extraction | no financial schema; no audit opinion; no fiscal-period awareness; no profile/ticker ergonomics |
| `camelot` / `tabula-py` | lattice + stream tables | no opinion, no segments, no notes, no provenance, no resume on crash |
| `marker` | Markdown from PDFs | output is prose, not structured financial JSON; can't be diffed reliably across re-extractions |
| LLM-only (GPT/Claude) | opinion + notes | expensive; non-deterministic JSON; **no** reproducible fingerprints for regression testing |
| **qscreen-filing-tool** | schema-stable filing JSON + audit + segments + notes + **SHA-256 cross-filing fingerprints** + math-identity gates + idempotent batch + SQLite resume | — |

Qstocks targets the *final-mile* problem: everyone gets text out of a PDF; very few tools give you a **diff-able, audit-traceable, jurisdiction-aware** JSON record you can hand to a quant, an LLM, or a regulatory pipeline.

> Long-form pitch for HN/Show, r/quant, IR Society, etc.: **[docs/SHOW_HN.md](docs/SHOW_HN.md)**. Every claim there is a verifiable CLI output, not marketing.



```bash
# install — three options, pick one
# (1) direct from the public GitHub Releases CDN (no PyPI needed, no token, no signup)
pip install https://github.com/Mine-FNL/qstocks-filing-tool/releases/download/v1.6.0/qscreen_filing_tool-1.6.0-py3-none-any.whl
# (2) proper PEP 503 simple index hosted on GitHub Pages (PyPI-equivalent for one package)
pip install --extra-index-url https://mine-fnl.github.io/qstocks-filing-tool/simple/ qscreen-filing-tool
# (3) from a clone (full source + dev extras)
git clone https://github.com/Mine-FNL/qstocks-filing-tool
cd qstocks-filing-tool && pip install -e ".[dev]"
# browser
qscreen-app          # → localhost:8765  (drag PDF, click Extract)
# CLI
qscreen-ingest report.pdf --symbol AKHI --year 2022
```

> Both option 1 and option 2 install the same wheel that `.github/workflows/publish.yml` would push to PyPI on the day the maintainer registers the Trusted Publisher. Today they're the public install paths; PyPI is queued behind that one-time UI click on `pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/`.

> **First run?** Follow **[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md)** — install → key → one command → every output.

## What it does

The engine is jurisdiction-agnostic: it takes a PDF of a financial report and emits a single JSON object
that captures every number, the audit opinion, segments, note text, and provenance. No values are invented;
illlegible cells are written as `null` with a warning.

Profiles plug in to teach the engine about a specific issuer + reporting regime (sector taxonomy, fiscal
calendar, currency, framework, watch-KPIs, known events). One profile bundle ships in the box — **Qatar**
(SEC-MENA-style reporting, 55 tickers) — and Qatar is the default `--jurisdiction`. Any other bundle works
the same way: drop a directory under `profiles/` that exposes `JURISDICTION_NAME`, a `build_profile(ticker)`
function, and a sector taxonomy. The CLI / browser app / engine itself don't change.

If you don't pass `--symbol`, no profile is loaded and the engine works purely on what's in the filing —
useful for one-off foreign issuers.

## What "production-ready" means here

- **Edits pass a 392-test pytest suite** on Python 3.9-3.13 (CI matrix). `python qscreen_ingest.py --self-test`
  runs an offline contract/normalize/merge sanity gate before anything else.
- **No hardcoded currency, exchange, or framework.** Add `--currency AED --framework AAOIFI --jurisdiction uae`
  and the engine renders UAE-aware prompts. The original QSE constants live in `profiles/qatar/` now.
- **Container image**: `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` ship slim (Python 3.11-slim, layered for caching); the
  Flask app exposes `/healthz` with version + active jurisdiction for orchestrator probes.
- **Logger** (`qscreen.ingest`): `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python3 qscreen_ingest.py …` for the case; `--quiet`
  suppresses the friendly progress prints so containers / CI only see structured stderr logs.
- **Upload hardened**: exponential backoff with `--upload-retries` / `--upload-backoff` / `--upload-timeout`
  on transient 5xx / 429 / network errors; URL is validated up-front so a typo doesn't 401 with a leaked
  bearer token; `User-Agent: qscreen-filing-tool/<version>` for server-side observability.
- **Stable CLI on bad input.** Missing arguments exit 2 with a one-line diagnostic; `Ctrl-C` exits 130;
  unexpected exceptions exit 1 with a clean line — `--debug` reverts to a Python traceback.
- **Back-compat shim.** Existing `import qatar` / `from qatar import profile_for_year(...)` callers keep
  working unchanged — the legacy package re-exports the new `profiles.qatar`.

## Run it

### New to this? Step-by-step (no coding experience needed)

It runs on your own computer. Steps 1–2 are one-time.

1. **Install Python** (free) from **[python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** and run the installer.
   On **Windows**, tick **“Add Python to PATH”** on the first screen.
2. **Download the tool.** At the top of this page click the green **`<> Code`** button → **Download ZIP**, then unzip it.
3. **Start it — just double-click:**
   - **Windows:** double-click **`start.bat`**
   - **Mac:** double-click **`start.command`** *(if it won’t open the first time, right-click it → **Open**)*

   The first run installs what it needs (a few minutes), then **your web browser opens by itself**.
4. **Use it.** Drag a PDF onto the page, type the company **symbol**, and click **Extract** — the sub-sector and the **fiscal year fill in by themselves**. When it finishes, click **⬇ Download**.

> **You do not need an API key.** The financial figures — income statement, balance sheet (even a scanned, stamped one), cash flows — are read **offline, on your own computer**. An API key is *optional*: save one in the **⚙️ Settings** panel only if you also want the **audit opinion and note texts** captured.

To stop the tool, close the window that opened. To run it again later, just double-click the launcher again (it starts in seconds after the first time).

<details><summary><b>Something not working?</b></summary>

- **Nothing happens / “Python not found”** — install Python from the link in step 1 (on Windows, tick **“Add Python to PATH”**), then double-click the launcher again.
- **Mac says it “can’t be opened”** — right-click **`start.command`** → **Open** → **Open**. You only need to do this the first time.
- **The page won’t load** — keep the window the launcher opened, and use exactly `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.
- **Want the audit opinion & notes too?** Save an API key in the **⚙️ Settings** panel (each provider has a **Get a key** link), or pick a **local** model under *Advanced* to do it with no key — see the offline-models section below.
</details>

### Comfortable with a terminal?

**Browser app:**

```bash
pip install flask pdfplumber requests
python3 qscreen_app.py
```

The first line installs the dependencies once; `python3 qscreen_app.py` starts the app and opens your browser.

Save your API key once in the **⚙️ Settings** panel, then drag in a PDF and click **Extract** —
the fiscal year & period are read from the filing automatically. No key? Pick a **local** model
under *Advanced* and run fully offline.

**CLI (one command per PDF):**

```bash
python3 qscreen_ingest.py report.pdf \
  --symbol QIBK --sector islamic_bank --year 2024 --period FY
```

Have `git`? One line clones, installs deps, and self-tests:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xBingBong69/qscreen-filing-tool/main/install.sh | bash
```

More detail below — [Install](#install) (incl. the packaged `qscreen-app` /
`qscreen-ingest` commands) and [Configure](#configure-once) for API keys.

## Install

**Option 1 — installer script** (clones to `~/.qscreen-filing-tool`, installs deps, self-tests):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xBingBong69/qscreen-filing-tool/main/install.sh | bash
```

Re-run anytime to update.

**Option 2 — pip** (installs the `qscreen-ingest` and `qscreen-app` commands):

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[xlsx,ocr]"
```

The second line adds the optional extras: `xlsx` (Excel export) and `ocr` (read scanned pages offline).

## Configure (once)

Create a `.env` next to the tool (it is gitignored). **Set the key for whichever
LLM provider you use** — the tool auto-detects it. *(Running a model locally?
You can skip this entirely — see [Local / offline models](#local--offline-models-no-api-key).)*

```
MINIMAX_API_KEY=...                 # or OPENROUTER_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY /
                                    # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / MOONSHOT_API_KEY (kimi)
INGEST_TOKEN=...                    # qscreen.app ingest token (only needed to upload)
QSCREEN_API_URL=https://qscreen.app # defaults to http://localhost:3004
```

### Choosing a provider / model

**Cloud** (need one API key):

| Provider | `--provider` | API key env | **Get a key (click)** | Default model |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| **MiniMax** | `minimax` | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | [platform.minimax.io](https://platform.minimax.io/) | `MiniMax-M2` |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) | `minimax/minimax-01` |
| Kimi (Moonshot) | `kimi` | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` | [platform.moonshot.ai](https://platform.moonshot.ai/console/api-keys) | `kimi-k2-0905-preview` |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | `gpt-4o` |
| Claude (Anthropic) | `anthropic` / `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) | `claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| Any OpenAI-compatible URL | `custom` | `LLM_API_KEY` *(optional)* | — | *(pass `--model` + `--base-url`)* |

**Local / offline** — run a model on your own laptop, **no API key**:

| Runtime | `--provider` | Default URL | Install / run | Default model |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Ollama** | `ollama` (alias `local`) | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/download) → `ollama pull gemma2:2b` | `gemma2:2b` |
| **MLX** (Apple) | `mlx` (alias `apple`) | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) → `mlx_lm.server --model …` | `mlx-community/gemma-3-270m-it-4bit` |
| LM Studio | `lmstudio` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/) → load model → Start Server | *(loaded model)* |
| llama.cpp | `llamacpp` | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) → `llama-server -m model.gguf` | *(loaded model)* |
| Jan | `jan` | `http://localhost:1337/v1` | [jan.ai](https://jan.ai/) → Local API Server → Start | *(loaded model)* |
| GPT4All | `gpt4all` | `http://localhost:4891/v1` | [nomic.ai/gpt4all](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all) → enable API server | *(loaded model)* |

> Get an API key from the **Get a key** link, then paste it into `.env` as the
> matching `*_API_KEY`. That's the whole setup. **For a local runtime there is no
> key** — just install it, start it, and pass `--provider ollama` (etc.).

- **Auto-detect:** leave `--provider` off and the tool uses whichever key is set.
- **Force a provider:** `--provider minimax` (or env `QSCREEN_PROVIDER=minimax`).
- **Pick a model:** `--model <id>` (or env `QSCREEN_MODEL`). Defaults are overridable —
  if a model id is rejected, the error tells you to pass `--model`.
- **Point at a different host/port:** `--base-url` (or env `QSCREEN_BASE_URL`) — e.g. a
  remote Ollama or a custom port.
- `python3 qscreen_ingest.py --list-providers` prints this table **and a line
  saying which provider it detects from your `.env` right now** — run it first if
  a key "isn't working".

> **`.env` not being picked up (esp. on Windows)?** Save it as **plain UTF-8, not
> "UTF-8 with BOM"** — a BOM glues itself onto the first variable name (so
> `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` is read as a different key and never detected). The tool now
> strips a BOM automatically, but some editors still surprise you; `--list-providers`
> will confirm what's detected.

> **Kimi / Moonshot 401?** Moonshot runs two regions with **non-interchangeable
> keys**. A key from `platform.moonshot.cn` will not authenticate against the
> default `api.moonshot.ai` endpoint. To use the `.cn` region, set
> `QSCREEN_BASE_URL=https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`.

> **Note on Claude Code on the web:** the managed environment's network policy
> may block LLM providers (e.g. `openrouter.ai`, `api.anthropic.com`). The
> extractor needs to reach the provider, so run it where that host is allowed,
> or permit it in the environment's network policy. A **local** runtime on
> `localhost` sidesteps this — nothing leaves your machine.

### Basic ↔ Pro — and ultra-light / offline models (no API key)

The tool runs in two modes. **Auto** (the default) picks Basic for local models and
Pro for cloud models; force either with `--basic` / `--pro` (or `--mode basic|pro`).

| Mode | What runs | Best model |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Basic** | line items are **read from the PDF's tables in code** — the model never touches a number; it only fills gaps and classifies the audit opinion | a tiny local model (Gemma 3 270M via MLX, small Ollama models) |
| **Basic + `--no-llm`** | pure Python, **no model at all** (audit `unknown`, notes `[]`) | none — fully offline, no key |
| **Pro** | the model extracts everything — richer notes, segments, audit narrative | a strong model: **GPT‑4.5+ / Claude Sonnet 4+ / MiniMax‑M2** |

**Run a 270M model on a Mac (MLX):**

```bash
pip install mlx-lm
mlx_lm.server --model mlx-community/gemma-3-270m-it-4bit

python3 qscreen_ingest.py report.pdf --provider mlx --basic \
  --symbol QIBK --sector islamic_bank --year 2024 --period FY --dry-run
```

**Or no model at all** (works anywhere, needs nothing running):

```bash
python3 qscreen_ingest.py report.pdf --no-llm \
  --symbol QIBK --sector islamic_bank --year 2024 --period FY --dry-run
```

**Why this works on a 270M model.** Such a small model can't reliably read numbers
out of dense tables, so Basic mode does the number-reading deterministically — the
PDF's tables are already captured as text, and the engine parses each row, maps the
label to a canonical account code, fixes the sign/scale, and recovers the prior-year
column, all in code. Every line item is tagged `basis: "parsed"` (from a table) vs
`"llm"` (from the model) so you can see exactly where each figure came from. The
output is the **same lossless filing contract** as Pro.

- **Use the `-it` (instruction-tuned) model.** `mlx-community/gemma-3-270m-it-4bit`
  follows the small asks far better than the base `…-270m-4bit`; the base still works
  for `--no-llm` (which asks it nothing).
- `--guided-notes` adds a best-effort notes pass; `--base-url` / `QSCREEN_BASE_URL`
  point at a remote/alternate host.
- Reliable audit/notes/segments need a capable model — use **Pro** for those.

## Option A — local browser app

```bash
python3 qscreen_app.py
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8765**, drag in a PDF, type the Symbol (a known symbol
auto-fills its sub-sector), click **Extract** — the **fiscal year & period are
read from the filing automatically** (a single box appears to type the year only
if it can't be read). Save your provider's API key once in the **⚙️ Settings**
panel and it's used right away — no editing `.env`, no restart.
When it finishes, click **Download** to get the `SYMBOL_YEAR_PERIOD_filing.json`.
Nothing is auto-uploaded — you stay in control. An **Upload to qscreen.app**
button appears only when the server has `INGEST_TOKEN` set, and only uploads
when you click it. An *Advanced* panel lets you pick a different provider/model —
including a **local** model on your laptop (Ollama, MLX, LM Studio, …) with no API
key — a **Basic ↔ Pro** mode selector (Basic = deterministic-first for tiny/local
models; Pro = a strong model extracts everything), and a **Run fully offline** box
that extracts straight from the PDF tables with no model at all.

## Option B — CLI (per PDF)

```bash
python3 qscreen_ingest.py <PDF_PATH> \
  --symbol QIBK --sector islamic_bank --year 2024 --period FY
```

- `--sector`: `conventional_bank | islamic_bank | industrial | insurance | other`
- `--period`: `FY | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | H1 | 9M` (default `FY`)
- `--provider` / `--model` — choose the LLM (see the table above; default auto-detect).
  Local runtimes (`ollama`, `mlx`, `lmstudio`, …) need **no key**.
- `--basic` / `--pro` (or `--mode basic|pro`) — Basic = deterministic-first (great for
  tiny/local models); Pro = the model extracts everything (use a strong model).
  `--no-llm` = Basic with **no model at all** (fully offline). `--guided-notes` adds a notes pass.
- `--dry-run` — produce the JSON **without** uploading (inspect first)
- `--export csv|xlsx|html` — also write a flat line-items table, the **Excel transcript**
  workbook, and/or the printable **statements document** (repeatable; see below)
- `--analyze` — also save the analysis + valuation JSON; `--report [--price P --shares N]`
  — also render the one-page **analyst report** (HTML + Markdown). Combine them to get
  **every artifact from one command** (see [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md))
- `--ocr auto|never|always` — OCR scanned pages (`auto` only does near-empty pages; needs the `ocr` extra + system `tesseract`/`poppler`)
- `--version` — print the tool version

The tool extracts (chunked page windows + table recovery), normalizes the
fields to the contract, validates, saves `SYMBOL_YEAR_PERIOD_filing.json`, and
uploads to qscreen.app. A non-conforming extract is saved but **not** uploaded.

## Outputs — pick what you need

Every extraction can produce, by your choice:

| Output | How | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **qscreen.app JSON** | always saved; `--upload`/the app button | the structured, uploadable filing contract |
| **Excel transcript** (`.xlsx`) | `--export xlsx`, or the app's *Excel transcript* button | a multi-sheet workbook: Summary, one sheet per statement (as printed, current + prior columns, numeric cells), a **multi-year grid** (canonical metrics × fiscal years — paste into a model), plus Segments & Notes |
| **Statements document** (`.html`) | `--export html`, or the app's *Statements (HTML)* button | a printable, human-readable rendering of the financials (faithful line items, current + comparative columns, accounting-style negatives) — print to PDF to share |
| **CSV** | `--export csv`, or the app's *CSV* button | a flat line-items table for quick grep/import |
| **Analysis / valuation JSON** | `--analyze` | computed ratios, red flags, DCF (`qscreen_analyze`/`qscreen_dcf`) |
| **Analyst report** (HTML/MD) | `qscreen_report.py`, or the app's *Analyst report* button | the one-page synthesis, with inline **SVG trend charts** (bars + sparklines) |

The browser app shows an **Outputs** row after each extract so you can download any
of these (or upload the JSON). `qscreen_workbook.build_workbook(filing, filings=…)`
builds the workbook programmatically; `POST /workbook` and `POST /export.csv` serve
the Excel and CSV downloads.

**Combine several years into one workbook** — the multi-year grid spans every year
you give it:

```bash
python3 qscreen_workbook.py QNBK_2021_FY_filing.json QNBK_2022_FY_filing.json QNBK_2023_FY_filing.json
# → QNBK_transcript.xlsx  (statement sheets from the latest year + a 2020–2023 grid)
```

In the app, the **Excel workbook** button in the compare/screen panel does the same
from a set of selected filing JSONs.

### Batch mode

Process many filings from a CSV manifest (`pdf,symbol,sector,year[,period]`):

```bash
python3 qscreen_ingest.py --manifest filings.csv --export csv
```

```csv
pdf,symbol,sector,year,period
reports/QIBK_2024.pdf,QIBK,islamic_bank,2024,FY
reports/QNBK_2023.pdf,QNBK,conventional_bank,2023,FY
```

One bad filing is reported and the batch continues; a summary prints at the end.

## Qatar intelligence (per-stock, time-aware)

The tool ships with a Qatar knowledge base (`qatar/`) covering all **55 QSE
tickers**. Each profile is *time-aware* — it knows each company's name changes,
foreign subsidiaries and their currencies, expected business/geography segments,
and a dated event timeline (acquisitions, Basel III, IFRS 9, IAS 29
hyperinflation, etc.). When you extract a filing for a known symbol + year, the
engine automatically injects a **"Qatar analyst context"** into the prompt so it
knows what to look for in *that* company and *that* year (e.g. QNB has Egypt from
2013 and Turkey from 2016; Masraf Al Rayan absorbed al khaliji in 2021).

Extraction now also captures the **prior-year comparative** column every filing
prints, so a single PDF yields two years of structured data.

Stack several filings into one per-symbol, multi-year series (the input for
analysis/valuation):

```bash
python3 qscreen_series.py --symbol QNBK QNBK_2022_FY_filing.json QNBK_2023_FY_filing.json
# → QNBK_series.json  (years, per-metric values, and any restatements flagged)
```

### Segment breakdown (by business line, geography & currency)

Extraction now also captures a typed `segments[]` section, and the analyzer
(`qscreen_analyze.analyze_segments`) turns it into a per-dimension breakdown with
year-on-year growth, share-of-total, **FX-exposure flags**, and **event
annotations** from the profile — e.g. QNB's Turkey segment is flagged as TRY with
"2016: Finansbank acquisition" and "2022: IAS 29 hyperinflation". The browser app
renders this automatically after an extract, and there's a `POST /segments` route
to re-analyze any filing JSON.

### Analysis — ratios, trends & red flags

`qscreen_analyze.analyze()` computes **sector-specific ratios** (ROE/ROA/NIM/cost-income/
NPL/CAR/LDR for banks; loss/expense/combined ratio for insurers; margins/leverage/FCF/
payout for the rest), **multi-year trends** (YoY, CAGR), and **rule-based red flags**
(low CAR near the Basel III minimum, rising NPLs, margin compression, negative FCF,
FX-driven equity erosion, restatements, adverse audit opinions). It **prefers figures the
company actually reported** (`basis: "reported"`), computes the rest (`basis: "computed"`),
and never invents a number.

```bash
python3 qscreen_analyze.py --symbol QNBK QNBK_2022_FY_filing.json QNBK_2023_FY_filing.json
# → QNBK_analysis.json + a printed red-flag summary.   Add --narrative for an
#   LLM analyst write-up grounded in the computed figures.
```

The browser app shows key ratios + red flags after each extract; `POST /analyze` returns
the full analysis object for one or more filings.

### Quarterly / TTM roll-ups

QSE interim filings report flow items (income statement, cash flow) as **YTD cumulative**
(Q1 = 3 months, H1/Q2 = 6, 9M/Q3 = 9, FY = 12) while balance-sheet items are point-in-time.
`qscreen_periods.build_ttm()` turns a set of filings for one company into a clean
**trailing-twelve-month** view:

- **TTM flows** = latest YTD + prior FY − prior matching YTD (e.g. `9M 2024 + FY 2023 − 9M 2023`)
- **stocks** = the latest period's balance-sheet values (point-in-time)
- **standalone quarter** = consecutive YTD deltas (e.g. `9M − H1 = Q3`)

It never silently annualises — if the prior-year filings needed for a true TTM aren't
supplied, it returns the reported YTD and says so in `basis`/`warnings`.

```bash
python3 qscreen_periods.py QNBK_2023_9M_filing.json QNBK_2023_FY_filing.json QNBK_2024_9M_filing.json
# → As of 9M 2024 — TTM = 9M 2024 + FY 2023 − 9M 2023
```

In the app, the **TTM** button in the compare/screen panel does the same from selected
filings; `POST /ttm` returns the roll-up as JSON.

### Valuation — DCF / forecast simulator

`qscreen_dcf.value()` picks the right model for the company type — **FCFE DCF** for
non-financials, a **residual-income (excess-return)** model for banks & insurers (whose
"free cash flow" is ill-defined), plus **DDM** when dividends are disclosed — **seeds the
assumptions from the company's own history**, and returns a year-by-year projection, the
explicit-vs-terminal PV split, equity & per-share value, upside vs a given price, and a
**growth × discount-rate sensitivity grid**.

```bash
python3 qscreen_dcf.py --symbol IQCD IQCD_2022_FY_filing.json IQCD_2023_FY_filing.json \
  --discount-rate 0.10 --terminal-growth 0.025 --shares 6050000000 --price 13.1
```

The browser app adds an **adjustable DCF panel** (discount rate / growth / terminal / years
/ shares / price) after each extract, recomputing live via `POST /dcf` with a sensitivity
grid. (A bank model collapses to book value when ROE equals the cost of equity — the
standard sanity check — and is covered by tests.)

### Peer comparison

`qscreen_analyze.compare()` ranks a stock against its profile-defined peers on the ratios
that matter for its type (banks on ROE / cost-income / NPL / CAR; industrials on margins /
leverage; …), scoring everyone on the *target's* archetype so it's apples-to-apples, with
the target highlighted and each metric ranked.

```bash
python3 qscreen_analyze.py --compare --symbol QNBK \
  QNBK_2023_FY_filing.json CBQK_2023_FY_filing.json DHBK_2023_FY_filing.json
```

In the browser, the **"Compare extracted filings"** panel takes several `*_filing.json`
files and renders a ranked table; `POST /compare` is the API.

### Saving & uploading the analysis ("both outputs")

The extract CLI can persist the derived analysis and valuation next to the filing with
`--analyze` (writes `<symbol>_<year>_<period>_analysis.json` and `_valuation.json`), and
**fold the analysis into the qscreen.app upload** additively with `--with-analysis`. In the
browser there's an "include analysis in upload" checkbox. The filing contract itself is
unchanged (the analysis rides as a sibling key), so a backend that ignores unknown keys is
unaffected.

### One-page analyst report

`qscreen_report.build_report()` synthesises everything — company context & **event
timeline**, multi-year figures with inline **SVG trend charts** (bar charts + per-row
sparklines, dependency-free via `qscreen_charts`), sector ratios (reported vs computed),
trends, red flags, the **segment breakdown** (with FX/event annotations) and the **DCF
valuation + sensitivity grid** — into a single self-contained **HTML** document (plus a
**Markdown** version).

```bash
python3 qscreen_report.py --symbol QNBK QNBK_2022_FY_filing.json QNBK_2023_FY_filing.json \
  --price 16 --shares 9200000000
# → QNBK_report.html + QNBK_report.md
```

The browser app has a **"📰 Analyst report"** button after each extract (downloads the HTML);
`POST /report` returns `{html, markdown}`.

### Watchlist screener

`qscreen_portfolio.roll_up()` screens a whole basket at once — it runs each stock through the
analysis + valuation engines and ranks them **healthiest-first** (fewest red-flag alerts,
then ROE), with latest-year ROE / margin, net-profit growth, red-flag counts and DCF value
(and upside when a price is supplied) side by side.

```bash
python3 qscreen_portfolio.py QNBK_2023_FY_filing.json CBQK_2023_FY_filing.json ORDS_2023_FY_filing.json
# → watchlist.html + watchlist.json
```

In the browser, the **Dashboard** button (in the compare/screen panel) takes several
`*_filing.json` files and downloads the ranked watchlist; `POST /portfolio` is the API.

## Jurisdictions

Profile bundles live in `profiles/<id>/`. **Qatar** (`profiles/qatar/`, 55 tickers) is
the default — matched automatically when no `--jurisdiction` is given. Two ways to extend:

**Drop-in bundle.** Create `profiles/<id>/__init__.py` with:

```python
JURISDICTION_NAME = "United Arab Emirates"
def build_profile(ticker):            # full profile dict, or None if unknown
    ...
def profile_for_year(ticker, year):   # same shape, temporal slice
    ...
def taxonomy():        return {"Banks": ["Conventional", "Islamic"]}
def symbol_subsector(): return {"ALDAR": "Real Estate Development"}
def subsector_to_archetype(): return {"Real Estate Development": "industrial"}
```

(any not-yet-known sub-sector or currency works the same way — `--sector other --currency AED`
covers everything the engine doesn't pre-classify.) Then run with `--jurisdiction <id>` (or
`QSCREEN_JURISDICTION=<id>` env var).

**In-process registration** (no extra package needed) — handy when the profile bundle is
computed at startup:

```python
import profiles
profiles.register("uae", "United Arab Emirates", profiles.JurisdictionLoader(
    build_profile=..., profile_for_year=..., taxonomy=...,
    symbol_subsector=..., subsector_to_archetype=...))
```

Already shipped data lives under `profiles/qatar/data/<TICKER>.json`; regenerate after any
profile-schema change with `python -c "import qatar; qatar.export_json()"`.

A profile-less run is also valid: `--currency EUR --framework IFRS` fills the fields and the
engine silently skips the company-context block.

## Testing

```bash
python3 qscreen_ingest.py --self-test
pytest -q
```

`--self-test` is the offline contract/normalize/merge check; `pytest -q` runs the full suite
(after `pip install -e ".[dev]"`). The self-test must print `✅ self-test passed`. CI runs both
on **Python 3.9–3.13** plus an app-smoke job that boots the Flask server and pings `/healthz`.

## Deployment

A thin production image is shipped via `Dockerfile` (Python 3.11-slim, layered for caching,
`/healthz` ready for orchestrator probes). Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t qscreen-filing-tool .
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 \
    -v "$PWD/.env:/app/.env" \
    -e QSCREEN_APP_HOST=0.0.0.0 -e QSCREEN_APP_PORT=8765 \
    -e INGEST_TOKEN=... -e QSCREEN_API_URL=https://your-target/ \
    qscreen-filing-tool
curl http://localhost:8765/healthz         # → {"status":"ok","version":"1.1.0",…}
```

Container-relevant env vars (all with safe defaults — see `Dockerfile`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `QSCREEN_API_URL` | ingest endpoint base (default `http://localhost:3004`) |
| `QSCREEN_JURISDICTION` | profile bundle id (default: first installed) |
| `QSCREEN_CURRENCY`, `QSCREEN_FRAMEWORK` | report-currency / report-framework override |
| `QSCREEN_UPLOAD_RETRIES`, `QSCREEN_UPLOAD_BACKOFF`, `QSCREEN_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT` | upload hardening |
| `INGEST_TOKEN` | bearer token for the upload endpoint |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `DEBUG`/`INFO`/`WARNING`/`ERROR` — Python logger threshold |

"""Source-of-truth data for the Qatar (QSE) per-stock knowledge base.

This module holds the QSE taxonomy and, per ticker, a *time-aware* profile: name
changes, the accounting framework by era, expected business/geography segments,
foreign subsidiaries (with their currencies and the year they joined), and a dated
event timeline (acquisitions, regulatory regimes, name changes). `qatar/__init__.py`
builds full profiles from this and exposes the public API.

Authoring rule: only encode facts we are confident about. Depth is greatest for the
majors; every one of the 55 tickers still resolves to a complete, valid profile.

# Expected segments (and a few high-confidence events) for the remaining tickers,
# so every one of the 55 is company-aware. Geography defaults to Qatar unless the
# company is known to operate abroad. segments_expected is *guidance* for the
# extractor ("capture what the filing actually shows"), so it is safe to populate
# broadly; events are only added where the fact and year are well established.
